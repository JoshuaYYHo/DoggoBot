# DoggoBot for Discord ðŸ¤–
The main functionality of this bot is to generate dog images using the dog api: https://dog.ceo/dog-api/

The purpose of this project was to integrate the discord api along with another api

Coded on repl.it so that UptimeRobot can ping the file keep_alive so that the bot can run 24/7 without having to use a paid service.
